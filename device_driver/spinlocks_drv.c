/*
 *    example_spinlock.c
As the name suggests, spinlocks lock up the CPU that the code is running on, 
taking 100% of its resources. Because of this you should only use the spinlock 
mechanism around code which is likely to take no more than a few milliseconds 
to run and so will not noticeably slow anything down from the userâ€™s point of 
view.
The example here is "irq safe" in that if interrupts happen during the 
lock then they will not be forgotten and will activate when the unlock happens, 
using the flags variable to retain their state.
